Demonstration of various transverse modes from a laser as a function of cavity alignment

Demonstration of the use of an intra-cavity adjustable aperture to control the number of transverse modes that can oscillate

Demonstration of the frequency spectrum of laser transverse modes

Demonstration of a method of isolating single transverse modes using a wire inside the laser cavity

Demonstration of the spectrum of isolated transverse modes

Demonstration of the change in orientation of a transverse mode

Demonstration of the effect of blocking one of the lobes of a two-lobe mode inside the laser cavity

Demonstration of the effect of blocking one of the lobes of a two-lobe mode outside the laser cavity
